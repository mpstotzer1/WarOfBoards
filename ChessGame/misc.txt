NOTES:
	-To draw a GameObject, simply do "window.draw(gameObject.getSprite());"
	-Sprite has a move function already built in! Check what other goodies SFML is hiding in the Sprite class
		(https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.5.1/classsf_1_1Sprite.php)
	-The Shot class's fireIfReady() must first check if the target != nullptr
	-Use SFML getPosition() for (x,y) position of objects, NOT the getOrigin()

TODO:
	-Figure out how all the Game and GameVariable and Wave objects are going to conglomerate
	-Rethink Tower, TowerDecorator, and TroopTower. Maybe they can all be simplified to a base
		Tower class and a derived TroopTower class?
	-Figure out the findNearestEnemy() function. Also, what are the exact "ranges" of action
		for each warrior?




wait, wait, let me explain:
	I have literally no idea how to manage classes in C++ (one file per class doesn't work here) so
I'm just including them all in one, monstrously long "ChessGame.cpp" file and praying that dropdown arrows
will make it readable. I'm optimistic that converting the big document into cute, chunky header files will be
fairly easy, so that's a problem for later.
	I don't really understand memory management or pointers, so I'm leaning really heavily into OOP design here
to try and get around that problem. I understand that C++ is not Java, but pointers are in chapter twelve of my online textbook
and I'm still in chapter one.

CONTACT INFO:
If you are smart with C++ and have knowledge about structuring large programs with it, please contact
me as I would be delighted to have an expert walk me through this stuff. You can examine the GitHub
repository (labeled WarOfBoards) and then tell me everything I'm doing wrong. Also, say hi to my group
partner, the graphics-making Cyrillic-reading machine, Summer.
